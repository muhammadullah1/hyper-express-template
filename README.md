HyperExpress: High Performance Node.js Webserver
Powered by uWebSockets.js

Motivation
HyperExpress aims to be a simple yet performant HTTP & Websocket Server.
Combined with the power of uWebsockets.js, a Node.js binding of uSockets written in C++, 
HyperExpress allows developers to unlock higher throughput for their web applications with their existing hardware.
This can allow many web applications to become much more performant on optimized data serving endpoints without having to scale hardware.
